Visual Representation
To create a visual flowchart based on the above structure, you can follow these steps:

Start: Use an oval shape to represent the start of the application.
App.java: Use a rectangle to represent the App.java class, indicating it contains the main() method.
Appconfig.java: Connect App.java to Appconfig.java with an arrow, indicating that it initializes configuration.
Car Models: Create two branches from Appconfig.java to Ferrari.java and Pajero.java, showing that both car models are initialized.
Fuel Consumption: From both Ferrari.java and Pajero.java, draw arrows to FuelConsumption.java to indicate that they call the fuel consumption methods.
Tires Management: Draw arrows from both car models to Tyres.java to show that they retrieve tire information.
Paint Management: Connect paint.java to both car models to indicate paint management.
Capacity Management: Connect capacity.java to both car models to show capacity management.
Color Options: Draw separate branches from paint.java to black.java and white.java to represent specific color options.
End: Use an oval shape to represent the end of the application.
